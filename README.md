# erlang_examples

This repo primarily contains examples coded along with the FutureLearn course https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-erlang, but may contain other ramblings as well.

* Compile the example files with c(filename_without_extension).
* Run tests with eunit:test(filename_without_extension).
